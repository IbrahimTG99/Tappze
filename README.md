# Tappze
This is a clone of the Tappze app, with a custom theme made by me
What the app allows you to do is to share profile links:
  * backend used firebase
  * user creates an account and the data is store in database the user password is encrypted
  * user can log in
  * save edit or delete links off social media apps in the app
  * open link takes you to page
  * validations and checks for signup and wrong input are in place
  * user data is saved offline and user can use the app without the internet and data will be synced when online 
  * MVVM was used developing this application
